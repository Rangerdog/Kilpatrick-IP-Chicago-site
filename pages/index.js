              After its recent combination with a corporate-focused firm in Chicago, Kilpatrick is now strategically seeking IP litigation partners in Chicago. This is a unique opportunity for top IP litigators to complement an existing client base and build a dynamic litigation practice alongside strong corporate colleagues.
            </p>
            <p className="font-semibold">
              There are currently no IP litigators in the Chicago office. You would be the first—backed by a national platform and deep bench of IP talent.
            </p>
            <p>
              The firm has a strong record of success at the PTAB, Federal Circuit, and in district courts nationwide. Chambers USA ranks Kilpatrick as Band 1 for IP in Georgia and North Carolina, and the firm has earned recognition in Managing IP, IAM Patent 1000, and Benchmark Litigation.
            </p>

              If you’re a successful IP litigation partner in Chicago—or open to relocating—this could be the high-level platform you’ve been waiting for.
