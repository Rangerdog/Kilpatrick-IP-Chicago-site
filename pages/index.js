            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
              Kilpatrick Townsend is actively seeking Intellectual Property litigation partners or a group to join its Chicago office. Following the firm’s recent merger with HMB, a corporate-focused Chicago firm, there is a strategic opening for IP litigators to complement the corporate team and benefit from immediate cross-practice opportunities.

            <p className="text-base text-gray-700 italic">
              Kilpatrick Townsend has entrusted Schrager Associates with this strategic search based on a longstanding working relationship.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              The firm’s recent merger with HMB brings a strong corporate client base in Chicago — but currently no IP litigation presence. This opens the door for a select group of IP partners to join a highly integrated platform with built-in client synergies and the full support of firm leadership.
